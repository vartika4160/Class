In C++, classes are essential constructs of object-oriented programming (OOP) that encapsulate both data and behavior into a single unit. A class declaration defines the structure and functionality of objects belonging to that class. Class members, such as variables and functions, can be declared as public, private, or protected, determining their visibility and access control. Objects are created from these classes, and special member functions like constructors and destructors can be used for initialization and resource management. Classes promote encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a structured and modular approach to code organization and enabling the building of complex systems with reusability and flexibility. Understanding classes is vital for effective C++ programming.
